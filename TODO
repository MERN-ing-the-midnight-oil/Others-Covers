1. Dynamic Form for Lending Library:
   Design the form fields needed to add books (like title, author, etc.).
   Implement a dynamic form using Formik with real-time validation.
   Use the Yup library for schema validation.
   Incorporate state tracking and management techniques (with React's Context API, Redux, or other state management libraries).
   Ensure the form is dynamic and responsive to user interactions.
2. Integrate with Book API:
   Choose between Open Library API or Google Books API.
   Make requests to the selected API based on form input to fetch suggestions of books.
   Display suggested books with titles and images to the user.
   Allow users to select a suggested book to add to their lending library.
3. Backend Setup for Lending Library (Simplified):
   Set up schemas and models for books and lending libraries in MongoDB.
   Implement routes and controllers to handle adding, removing, and editing books in the lending library.
   Seed the database with placeholder data if necessary.
4. Frontend Connection and Display:
   Connect the dynamic form to your backend to submit data.
   Display the user’s lending library (you can use placeholder user data for now).
   Implement functions to handle adding, removing, and editing books.
5. Styling and User Experience:
   Style the dynamic form and lending library display.
   Make sure the user interface is intuitive and responsive.
6. Testing and Debugging:
   Test the dynamic form’s functionality and ensure it interacts with the backend correctly.
   Debug any issues that arise during the testing process.
   Future Tasks (To be done later):\*\*
   User Authentication and Authorization.
   User Dashboard Setup.
   Finalize Backend Setup with User Data.
   Extensive Testing and Debugging.
   Documentation and Code Cleanup.
